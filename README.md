My family plays a card game called Shanghai, similar to Phase 10. It can be difficult for people to keep track of which round we are on, so I designed a wall-mount board with LED bulbs which will track the rounds.

For use on an arduino, this monitors an input (RF remote fob) for button presses. On each button press, the output pin will change, causing the LED to cycle on the game tracking board.
